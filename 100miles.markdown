# The 100 mile diet

It's exhausting, mentally and physically. I crave sugar and salt; rice is off the menu; I long for thick slices of crusty bread. I feel tired from the mere knowledge that I am not eating glucose, making the true physiological effects difficult to disentangle. Or is that just another psychological effect? I don't know what my next meal will be, and I'm skeptical that there is any true significance to what I'm doing.

I'm 73 minutes in, about 30 days still to go. The only food that I can eat for the next month must be entirely sourced within 100 mile radius. Here are the rules:

1. All food and drink consumed must be grown or produced within 100 miles of my current location.
2. The perimeter centring 'current location' is defined as being anywhere that I happen to be provided that I haven't travelled there for the purpose of acquiring food. But incidental acquisitions are acceptable. For example, living in Edinburgh means that the radius is centred around my home; but if I went to Manchester for a weekend then the local area will be centred there for the duration of the visit.
3. Food or drink with unknown sources are not allowed.
4. Every ingredient of any processed food consumed must follow rule #1. So, essentially, no processed food.
5. Local produce that uses non-local fertilisers or pesticides are allowed, as is produce grown locally from non-local seeds.
6. Livestock must be reared locally, must graze on local pasture only, and must only consume grain etc produced locally.
7. Medication is allowed. (And may be needed.)
8. The challenge lasts for 30 days, beginning 00:00 Monday 28th June 2010, ending 00:00 Wednesday 28th July 2010.

All food, sources, prices, and meal recipes will be recorded. Survival should be relatively easy, it's the height of summer and I'm surrounded by countryside. But it's the convenience and the luxury that I'm going to miss. No sugar, no salt or spices; no chocolate, biscuits, bread, rice. No orange juice; no processed foods or takeaways. No canteen food for lunch times. Nothing at Alton Towers (scheduled for 2 weeks' time) and terrifying uncertainty for 2 nights' camping at Kelburn Garden Party next week. I just might have stumbled across the perfect way to ruin summer. Anyway, inspiration comes from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100-Mile_Diet), these people did it for a whole year somewhere in North America and it looks like thousands of people have successfully done this all over the world.

This map shows the area that I will define as 'local' for the vast majority of the time:

It looks pretty big. Very rough estimate - 30% mountains, 30% sea, 30% farmland and 10% urban. Relatively speaking, Edinburgh is probably a really good place to try this.

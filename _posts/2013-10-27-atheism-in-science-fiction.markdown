A couple of weeks ago the Edinburgh University Humanist Society hosted [Ken MacLeod][macloud] who gave a talk about the influence of science fiction on modern secularism.

This idea absolutely resonates with my own view that while non-fictional scientific literature is essential, and does inherently question religious beliefs, it's probably fictional work that often makes direct challenges to religious epistemology more thoroughly.

The following are science fiction works, in no particular order, that perhaps illustrate this point:

- "Revolt in 2100" by Robert A. Heinlein
- "The Compleat Boucher" by Anthony Boucher
- "The streets of Ashkelon" by Harry Harrison
- "Last and first man" and "Star Maker" by Olaf Stapledon
- "A case of conscience" by James Blish
- "Behold the man" by Michael Moorcock ("Hell is the absence of God..")
- "Towing Jehova" by James Morrow
- "Hominids" by Robert J. Sawyer ("From our conviction that there is no life after death.")
- "The night sessions" and "A case of consilience" by Ken MacLeod
- "The Chrysalids" by John Wyndham
- "Country of the blind" by HG Wells (As William Burroughs put it, "Don't you understand? I can see!")
- "Man in the high castle" by Philip K. Dick

Other authors were also mentioned without specific titles:

- Margaret Atwood
- Kurt Vonnegut
- HP Lovecraft
- Arthur C. Clarke
But this is not so useful, they have millions of books each.

Sitting amongst a crowd of humanists celebrating the works of other humanists led to some largely optimistic discussions regarding the future of society etc. But one fairly salient point was made that the ideas that shape the future of culture and society won't necessarily be those that explain the universe the most accurately, or prove to be the most morally sound or scientifically rigorous; but they will necessarily be the ones that spread the quickest, and embed more permanently. Religion, as a meme, has proven to be extremely potent and it's absence in the future is not guaranteed.

Also - these links came up and they look interesting:

- [Extropians][extropy] are quite concerned about the future and they're doing stuff about it. So weird.
- [Human Genre Project][genre] is a collection of short stories with a genetic element to them
[Pippa Goldschmidt][goldschmidt] has a blog about the relationship between science and fiction
[The Genomics Forum][genomics] is an Edinburgh based public discourse on the integration of genomic research into society and policy
Finally, Isaac Asimov has something to say on the subject. This story, written in 1956, is absolutely brilliant: [The last question][asimov]. The future is here, his 'MultiVAC' sounds a lot like the internet. How can entropy be reversed?

First thing to do is resize the Terminal window. This is critical.

<!--more-->

Edit the following line in the file `/usr/share/vte/termcap/xterm:`

    :co#76:it#8:li#61:\

Toggle 'hide buttons' for the menu bars to make them fit nicely. Good. OCD moment over.

Then perform updates (generally ~600Mb)

    yum update

Remove desktop icons:

    yum install gconf-editor
    gconf-editor

And then navigate to `apps` -> `nautilus` -> `desktop`, and untick things.


Install emacs:

    yum install emacs

Launching without X window running (runlevel 3):

From root, edit the file `/etc/inittab`, replacing the line:

    d:5:initdefault

to

    d:3:initdefault

To start X from the command line, use `startx`

To revert to X from inside runlevel 3:

    /sbin/init 5

To end X session and return to command line:

    killall X

Setting up network connections for runlevel 3 requires the following lines to be included in the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcg-wlan0`:

    DEVICEC=wlan0
    ONBOOT=yes
    USERCTL=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    MODE=Managed
    TYPE=Wireless
    ESSID=
    RATE=54Mb/s

For Atheros cards the ath5k kernal is now included as part of the default generic `wext` kernal.

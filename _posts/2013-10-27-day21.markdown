Begging them to open a branch in Edinburgh. 

<!--more-->

I don't like to beg, it hurts my knees. But sometimes the cause is worthy, and the email certainly carried extra weight with that picture.

**Breakfast** - Porridge, honey, raspberries; carrot juice

**Lunch** - Cottage pie with salad.

**Dinner** - Cottage pie with salad and ricotta cheese. All of these things are really bland, I'm low on ideas.

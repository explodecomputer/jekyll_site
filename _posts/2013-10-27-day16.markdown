Krispy Kreme doughnuts. Despite the false appellation, does anything taste quite as magnificent? If so, please let me know. There is one on my table and I wish to eat it. Should cathartic transference exist, it is difficult to achieve, and trying is fraught with danger.

**Breakfast** - Porridge with honey.

**Lunch** - Fried potatoes and herbs with fried eggs.

**Dinner** - Gnocchi with chicken and tomatoes, with salad and herbs from home.

The gnocchi was made following [this recipe](http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-make-gnocchi). I was surprised from two fronts: how easy it was to make, and how tasty it was to eat. I did plan to add some nettles to the mixture but after a brief hunt around the neighbourhood I returned empty handed. It was no matter though - plain tasted fine. I also made some carrot juice; four medium carrots ~= 3/4 glass. Even without the ginger it tasted pretty good. Quite excited about juice making prospects.

The green grocers are trying to sabotage me. 

<!--more-->

 First of all, since I told them what I'm doing a suspiciously large proportion of their stock suddenly bears the label "Scottish". Second, every time I go in they offer me free stuff that they know I can't eat. Bananas aren't local. That pineapple smells delicious and you know it. Truly reprehensible behaviour.

Football match in the morning meant another missed farmers' market. Afterwards I cooked some smoked mackerel with tomatoes and mushrooms and ate it with mozzarella cheese. Porridge in the evening, with honey and strawberries.

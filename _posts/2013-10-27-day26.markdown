Friday evening was wonderful. I was supposed to go to a barbecue, and the people there didn't know about my predicament. So what do you say? "Sorry, I can't eat any of your food - it's morally beneath me. Same goes with your alcohol."

So, I didn't go.

Instead I bought a huge steak, and watched West Wing - quite a pleasing evening actually. It was by a large margin the most expensive meal i've had all month, the sirloin alone costing Â£6, but it was completely incredible! Could have done with some salt and pepper, but nevermind that.

Breakfast was some berries and a flapjack. Lunch, gnocchi and vegetables from the day before and berries throughout the day - kindly donated by Sue. Thanks Sue.

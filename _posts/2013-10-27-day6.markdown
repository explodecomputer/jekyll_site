So, there were no cockles on the beach. Major disappointment.

Awoke early, made a 2-egg cheese and chilli omelette, and hard boiled my remaining 3 eggs to take with me. Over the course of Saturday here is what I ate:

- Omelette (2 eggs, chilli, cheese)
- 1 hard boiled egg
- ~8 carrots
- Punnet of strawberries
- 2 flapjacks

I didn't know when I'd be coming back so I tried to ration stuff as much as possible. The music was cool, in particular Lipsync for a Lullaby and Captain Slackship's Mezzanine Allstars. Also, the Kelburn estate is completely beautiful.

It was so long ago, I can't remember all the things I ate on Thursday. Morning was a mushroom omelette, then some other things, and then at night it was gnocchi. Gnocchi is seriously good stuff, it costs about a quid, and 15 minutes to make two portions. I had it with a kind of sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, courgette and herbs.

I played football that day. I ached for sugar, it was maddening.

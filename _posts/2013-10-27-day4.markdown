This weekend I'm camping in the West of Scotland at the Kelburn Garden Party. Food is a concern, so I emailed the organisers to see what they will have on the site. Here is the reply:

> There is a cafe on site that will be serving a fullish menu, from greasy spoon stuff to currys or lasagne, Soups and sandwiches.  There is also an hotdog stand running. Hope that helps.

I'm so screwed. Anyway, forgot to record what I ate yesterday, here it is:

**Breakfast** - Porridge with honey.

**Lunch** - Slightly harder porridge with live natural yogurt and strawberries.

**Dinner** - Two herring fillets (fried in butter, garlic, chillies), with asparagus cream sauce (made from asparagus, tomatoes, double cream, Mull of Kintyre cheese), plus some gooseberries.

It's 9.30am, I've not really got anything to eat today but I have to go in to work. Forward planning is so tedious.

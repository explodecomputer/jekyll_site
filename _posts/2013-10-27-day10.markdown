was shocked to notice, in the mirror this morning, that my head has turned into a perfect strawberry. I suppose it's true what they say - you are what you eat. And I am now a strawberry.

I was struggling to remember what I ate 2 days ago.. it did eventually come back to me though.

**Breakfast** - Chapattis with two eggs + chillis. There was plenty of dough left from the day before, I added some water and a drop of oil (made from local olives from Sorrento, collected on a visit over Easter), and used a very high heat. The key seems to be cooking on one side for a few seconds until colour appears, then turning over to cook fully on the other side without pressing, then turning back to cook on the first side, pressing to keep the steam out. Being able to make chapattis has changed my life. I feel like I understand old Pakistani ladies at a more fundamental level now, I almost signed up to reply to this message board at Indus Ladies. Perhaps I'll learn to make masala before going that far though.

**Lunch** - Some strawberries. That is all I remember.

**Dinner** - Fresh mackerel with chillies, butter, garlic, and honey (a bit too much honey actually), plus fried eggs and fried chapattis.

I don't like the style of this website. It has to change.

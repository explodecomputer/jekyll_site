I could murder a swiss roll.

Alas, not for another 22 days. Day 8's food comprised the following:

**Breakfast** - Porridge with honey. I was disappointed with the Chain Bridge Farm Tweedside honey, quite granular. I have now found some blossom honey from perthshire and it's smooth and strong. It might make the flapjacks more flavoursome.

**Lunch** - Potato cakes, two smoked mackarels, double cream.

**Dinner** - Porridge with strawberries and some carrots. And then a few slices of cheese. Pah.

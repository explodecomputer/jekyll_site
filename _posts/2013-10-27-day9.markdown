Work was quite consuming, it distracted me from hunger.

<!--more-->

Here is what I ate:

**Breakfast** - Yogurt, honey, strawberries. Plus some carrots (separately...)

**Lunch** - Baked salmon (with garlic, chillies, butter and honey wrapped in foil, it was so good) with three remaining potato cakes (grilled with cheese), half a broccoli and some double cream.

**Dinner** - Two eggs and two chapattis. The chapattis were quite hard, I think it's possible that the dough was too dry. Some dough remains, I'll try adding some water and oil to it before making any more.

As I write I realise that I'm quite hungry. Normally I am eating (mostly sweet stuff) fairly constantly, but it's very inconvenient to do that now. Perhaps my meals need to be bigger.

Working intensely, problems unrelenting, and appetite forgotten.

I ate two mozzarella omelettes today. Also - I made flapjacks with strawberries. It worked pretty well.

Rejecting convenience is generally quite difficult, but being stubborn is fairly easy. I could have done this better, but instead I just survived.

Dave brought me some lamb from his farm in Carlisle. A beautiful piece of shoulder, it looked fantastic. A random act of kindness, I'll savour this one.

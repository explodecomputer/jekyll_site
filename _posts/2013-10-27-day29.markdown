I felt no sense of compromise today.

Despite being unsalted, food no longer tastes unseasoned and the disappointment associated with unavailability is kind of offset by the concept of providence. Having said that, the unavailability is artificial - at all levels I know this choice is temporary. I wonder how much harder it would be without the promise of things returning back to normal.

**Breakfast** - Porridge, honey

**Lunch** - Salad with rainbow chard, smoked mackerel cooked with tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese.

**Dinner** - This was a treat! Slow roast lamb (thanks Dave), with homegrown rosemary and garlic, served with ricotta gnocchi, shiitake mushrooms, and chard. And carrot juice!

Been simultaneously awaiting and avoiding this day.

<!--more-->

I've been planning what to eat tomorrow for some time, and I'm excited about it. But, counting the days over the last month has only made more conspicuous how unproductive I've been with my work. Oh well. Here's what I ate today:

**Breakfast** - Porridge, honey

**Lunch** - Ricotta and chive gnocchi, rainbow chard, smoked mackerel and tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms, mozzarella cheese.

**Dinner** - Roast lamb with mozzarella and rainbow chard.

And then at midnight I ate a slice of mango cheesecake. And then I felt a bit sick.

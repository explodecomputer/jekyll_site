I love carrot juice. If there were something I could do with the waste from the juicer it would be perfect.

**Breakfast** - Porridge with honey

**Lunch** - Gnocchi + chicken and tomatoes, with salad from the garden

**Dinner** - The same. That was the last of the gnocchi - 20 minutes to make, probably less than Â£1 in total, and 3 meals from it.

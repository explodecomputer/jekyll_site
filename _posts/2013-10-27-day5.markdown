Today I am a man who has completed a week, recounting the days of a man who was yet to complete a week. 

<!--more-->

Naturally the details are hazy, like in a dream, or when remembering a fever. (I forgot to write up on Friday, and I was away for the weekend.)

**Breakfast** - Natural set live yogurt (sadly the only type of local yogurt I can find) + honey + raspberries.

**Lunch** - Punnet of strawberries. Can't remember anything else, apart from it being cake day and not being allowed to eat any.. sigh.

**Dinner** - Herring and asparagus cream sauce (left over from Thursday), plus fried egg.

And then the preparations began for the coming weekend, when I would be camping in Largs, West coast of Scotland, at a music festival. I bought some Perthshire carrots and some Angus strawberries, and made some more honey flapjacks. And this concluded the preparations. That night I dreamt that they would be selling cockles on the beach at Largs.

My weight has reduced by about 1.5kg in 3 weeks, this was not intended. 

<!--more-->

I think it's partly because the prospect of bad food reduces appetite, and a bad cook depending on his own cooking will inevitably fuel this problem. Entering the 4th week and I didn't eat anything until 3pm. The fast was broken with some porridge and some carrots. Later I had some more of the dreadful cottage pie. Later still, I ate microwaved eggs (with honey). I stood in the dim light, peering into the microwave and watched the mixture swell and undulate in the bowl. I used to eat this when I was a child. I remembered the accompanying cartoons, and the ubiquitous burnt tongue.

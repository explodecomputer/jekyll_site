A salted caramel doughnut. Oh my god.

But instead, more chapattis, outlined in excruciating detail below:

**Breakfast** - Some raspberries and gooseberries blended with honey cream and yogurt.

**Lunch** - I found a tomato in the fridge, it was pretty old but I thought it would be a good idea to make an omelette with it. Turns out - not so good an idea. Eggs, cheese, chillies, and an extremely old tomato, eaten with rapidly hardening chapattis. This is bleak.

**Dinner** - I also found some broccoli left over from an ancient time, added it to some mashed potatoes, ate it with some crispy chapatti dust.

I never proof read this entries, this can only lead to embarrassment.

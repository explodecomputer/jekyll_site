Nicaragua: a country in Central America, and outside my 100 mile radius. Equal Exchange: an Edinburgh-based company that labels its honey with the word Edinburgh about 15 times, tricking the weary locavore into believing it to be fair game.

Excuses aside, the hard truth is that I bought the non-local honey, I used it to make non-local flapjacks, and then I ate them. Afterwards, Susie pointed out my error, and mistakenly judged it to be hilarious.

It's not hilarious, it's a tragedy. The devastating irony is that at the time of buying said non-local honey I already had some tasty and satisfying local honey at home. It was a decision so irrational that mere happenstance is simply unable to offer explanation. I blame Suarez, he must have deliberately handled it into my basket.

Anyway, on Friday I did manage to eat some remorse-free local food:

**Breakfast** - Some strawberries.

**Lunch** - Some boiled eggs and a couple of grilled smoked mackerel fillets, and some flapjacks.

**Dinner** - Porridge with strawberries and honey. (I am unsure which honey. The shame...)

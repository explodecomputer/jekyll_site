Today I relearned that philosophical skepticism has no place in the kitchen.

**Breakfast** - Some carrots

**Lunch** - Ricotta and chive gnocchi (recipe adapted from here) with grilled mackerel and sage and chilli butter sauce. This was phenomenally good, and very easy to make. There was a left over egg white, I whisked this with some honey and tried to make a meringue. It failed to solidify properly in the oven, but it was quite tasty with strawberries and cream.

**Dinner** - I grilled some mozzarella cheese (from Fife!) on the cottage pie. Mozzarella has a wonderful texture, but no real taste to speak of, so this made very little improvement to the flavour. This disappointment was alleviated with some strawberry and honey sorbet, which was remarkably easy to make: Blend strawberries and honey, simmer in a pan, allow to cool, and freeze. After an hour whisk it up and freeze again. Repeat until tedium causes you to eat it.

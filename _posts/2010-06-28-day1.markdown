Most of the food eaten today was purchased from the farmers' market on Saturday.

Ok another example <span>$\alpha + 3$</span>

**Breakfast** - half an omelette with onions, chillies and spinach, fried in butter.

**Lunch** - the other half.

**Dinner** - Spinach, cheese (Scottish cheddar from Kinross with no additives), garlic, and potato mash with a kind of disappointing lamb (from the Pentland Hills), courgette, and onion curry, + green salad.

No seasoning or spices will prove to be tricky, I'll have to find ways to make things tasty some other way. I also ate a load of strawberries and raspberries (the latter with double cream). So, wild oscillations between decadence and utility.

Today's food was quite expensive. I need to find cheap snacks, because just eating soft fruits is going to break the bank. Approximately Â£8 spent today.

So, I went to the pub this evening to watch Brazil-Chile. I drank some water, that is all. I had no intention of buying anything, this might prove tricky. A tricky month to start appearing frugal.

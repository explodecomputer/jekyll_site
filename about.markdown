The purpose of building this site was to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">procrastinate</span> learn ruby. The previous version of this site was built as a means to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">procrastinate also</span> learn some MySQL and PHP. It turns out that building websites is a great way to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">procrastinate</span> learn programming languages, and to get a little insight into how the internet works. 

## Credits

This is a static site, rendered with [Jekyl][jekyl] using the [Twitter Bootstrap 3][bootstrap] boilerplate to make it responsive. The code is on [github][github], and the site is hosted at [Digital Ocean][digitalocean]. Try it out on your phone it should scale nicely.

It uses the following plugins:

- A flickr set fetcher by somebody called [tsmango][flickr]
- A youtube video embedder by somebody called [joelverhagen][youtube]

I got design inspiration from multiple sources, including:

- [Readability][readability]
- [A list apart][alistapart]
- [The elements of typographic style applied to the web][elements]
- [lhzhang.com][lhzhang] and [yihui.name][yihui]

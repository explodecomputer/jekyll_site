The purpose of building this site was to learn ruby. The previous version of this site was built as a means to learn some MySQL and PHP. It turns out that building websites is a great way to learn programming languages, and to get a little insight into how the internet works. 

## Credits

This is a static site, rendered with [Jekyl][jekyl] using the [Twitter Bootstrap 3][bootstrap] boilerplate to make it responsive. The code is on [github][github], and the site is hosted at [Digital Ocean][digitalocean]. Try it out on your phone it should scale nicely.

I got design inspiration from multiple sources, including:

- [Readability][readability]
- [A list apart][alistapart]
- [The elements of typographic style applied to the web][elements]
- [lhzhang.com][lhzhang] and [yihui.name][yihui]
